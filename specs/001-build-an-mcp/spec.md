   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines

- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements

- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation

When creating this spec from a user prompt:

1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-09-25

- Q: What‚Äôs the retention and access policy for the MCP‚Äôs query/response logs (to satisfy FR-006)? ‚Üí A: Retain 14 days; only platform operators can access
- Q: How should the MCP validate Flutter SDK version inputs before hitting pub.dev? ‚Üí A: Accept exact semantic versions plus caret constraints
- Q: What‚Äôs the target end-to-end response time for an MCP search request (from tool invocation to returning results to the assistant)? ‚Üí A: ‚â§5.0 seconds typical, ‚â§7.0 seconds p95
- Q: Which MCP tools should the server expose? ‚Üí A: Eight discrete tools (search packages, latest version, check compatibility, list versions, package details, publisher packages, score insights, dependency inspector)
- Q: How should the MCP handle search results beyond the initial 10 entries when users want to browse more packages? ‚Üí A: Always return only the top 10 results and note that broader exploration requires a new query
- Q: When the MCP receives a transient failure from pub.dev (e.g., network timeout or 5xx), what recovery behavior should it apply before surfacing the error? ‚Üí A: Retry up to three times with exponential backoff before surfacing the error
- Q: What depth of detail should the `dependency_inspector` tool provide when evaluating a package? ‚Üí A: Provide the full dependency tree (direct + transitive) including version constraints and resolution status
- Q: What data should the `score_insights` tool return for a package? ‚Üí A: The overall score plus the individual component scores (e.g., popularity, likes, pub points) with brief explanations

## User Scenarios & Testing _(mandatory)_

### Primary User Story

An AI assistant operator wants to leverage an MCP server to query pub.dev so they can discover Dart and Flutter packages, review available versions, and identify versions compatible with their existing Flutter project without leaving the assistant environment.

### Acceptance Scenarios

1. **Given** a keyword such as "http client", **When** the user invokes the MCP tool to search pub.dev, **Then** the assistant returns a ranked list of matching packages including summary metadata.
2. **Given** a selected package identifier and no version specified, **When** the user asks for the latest stable release, **Then** the assistant responds with the newest non-prerelease version number, release date, and link to release notes if available.
3. **Given** a Flutter project semantic version requirement (e.g., Flutter 3.24.0) and a target package, **When** the user requests a compatible package version, **Then** the assistant returns the newest package version whose SDK constraints satisfy the provided Flutter SDK version along with compatibility rationale.

### Edge Cases

- What happens when the pub.dev API rate limit is hit or responds with HTTP 429? The assistant must surface the limitation and provide retry guidance without terminating the session.
- How does the system handle packages that are discontinued, unlisted, or missing version metadata? The assistant must state the package status and advise on alternatives.
- How are prerelease versions treated when the user explicitly requests stable releases only? The assistant must respect stability preferences and explain if only prerelease versions exist.

## Requirements _(mandatory)_

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: System MUST let users search pub.dev packages by keyword and return only the top 10 relevant results with package name, summary, publisher, and popularity metrics, while signalling that additional packages require a follow-up query.
- **FR-002**: System MUST provide the most recent stable version details (version number, release date, SDK constraints) when given a package identifier without a version.
- **FR-003**: System MUST evaluate package SDK compatibility against a supplied Flutter SDK version and recommend the newest version that satisfies the constraint, or explicitly state that none is available.
- **FR-004**: System MUST expose a way to retrieve a package‚Äôs version history including prerelease tags upon explicit user request.
- **FR-005**: System MUST retry failed pub.dev calls up to three times with exponential backoff (‚â§1s initial delay) before presenting clear error messages and remediation guidance when endpoints are unreachable, rate limited, or return malformed data.
- **FR-006**: System MUST log user queries and responses for observability while redacting sensitive project identifiers, retaining records 14 days with access limited to platform operators.
- **FR-007**: System MUST validate input parameters (package name format, Flutter version pattern) before calling pub.dev and reject invalid requests with actionable feedback, accepting Flutter versions as exact semantic versions or caret constraints (e.g., ^3.22.0).
- **FR-008**: System MUST expose eight MCP tools: `search_packages`, `latest_version`, `check_compatibility`, `list_versions`, `package_details`, `publisher_packages`, `score_insights`, and `dependency_inspector`, each returning structured JSON shaped for assistant consumption, with `dependency_inspector` supplying the full dependency tree (direct and transitive) including version constraints and resolution status, and `score_insights` providing the overall package score plus individual component scores (popularity, likes, pub points) accompanied by brief explanations.

### Key Entities _(include if feature involves data)_

- **Package Summary**: Represents a search result entry containing package name, description snippet, publisher, likes, points, popularity, and latest stable version.
- **Version Detail**: Describes a specific package release with version number, release date, SDK constraints, stability flag, and release notes link.
- **Compatibility Request**: Captures the Flutter SDK version, project dependency constraints, and target package needed to evaluate compatibility outcomes.
- **Dependency Node**: Represents a node in the dependency tree with package name, requested constraint, resolved version, and compatibility status (direct or transitive).
- **Score Insight**: Summarizes the overall pub.dev score alongside component metrics (popularity, likes, pub points) and a short explanation for each component.

### Non-Functional Requirements

- **NFR-001 (Performance)**: MCP search responses SHOULD complete within 5.0 seconds for typical requests and MUST complete within 7.0 seconds at the 95th percentile, including pub.dev API latency.
- **NFR-002 (Reliability)**: For transient pub.dev failures (timeouts or 5xx), the MCP MUST attempt up to three retries with exponential backoff before surfacing an error to the assistant.
